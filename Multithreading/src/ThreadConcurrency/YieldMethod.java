/*
In Java, the yield() method is part of the Thread class, used to suggest to the thread scheduler that the current thread is willing to yield its current use of a processor.
It temporarily pauses its execution and allows other threads of the same or higher priority to execute.
However, itâ€™s merely a suggestion, and the thread scheduler may or may not honor it.

Features of yield() in Java:
1.Non-blocking: The thread that calls yield() remains in the Runnable state, not Blocked or Waiting.
2.Voluntary Pause: It allows threads with equal or higher priority a chance to execute.
3.Platform-dependent: The behavior of yield() depends on the operating system and JVM implementation.
4.No Guarantee: There's no guarantee that another thread will get the CPU when yield() is called.
