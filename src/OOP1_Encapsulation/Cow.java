/*
Polymorphism in OOP
    -Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class.
    -This concept supports dynamic method resolution at runtime, where the method to be invoked is determined based on the actual object type, not the reference type.

Method Overriding in OOP
    -Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.
    -The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the superclass.

Features of Polymorphism
    1.Method Overriding: A subclass can provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class.
    2.Late Binding (Dynamic Dispatch): The method that gets called is determined at runtime based on the actual object type, not the reference type.
    3.Type Casting: Allows converting an object reference from one type to another, either by widening (upcasting) or narrowing (downcasting).
    4.Superclass Method Invocation: Using super.method() to invoke the superclass method in the subclassâ€™s overriding method.
    5.Inheritance: A subclass inherits methods and fields from its superclass, which forms the basis for polymorphism.

        cowRef.printName(); // I'm a whale (Whale's method is called)
